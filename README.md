# MACE-MP models

This repository contains the MACE-MP pre-trained foundation models for materials chemistry, parameterised for 89 chemical elements.

To use the models please install the [MACE code](https://github.com/ACEsuit/mace).

## Models

The first generation of models are available in the [MACE-MP-0](https://github.com/ACEsuit/mace-mp/releases/tag/mace_mp_0).

We subsequently released a second generation of models in the [MACE-MP-0b](https://github.com/ACEsuit/mace-mp/releases/tag/mace_mp_0b), [MACE-MP-0b2](https://github.com/ACEsuit/mace-mp/releases/tag/mace_mp_0b2) and [MACE-MP-0b3](https://github.com/ACEsuit/mace-mp/releases/tag/mace_mp_0b3) releases.
This release includes models with improved stability during MD simulations, using core repulsion, a new repulsion regularization for high pressure, and a few extra high pressure training examples. Moreover,
we recommend using the second generation models for [fine-tuning](https://mace-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/finetuning.html).

We have also released a model trained on an enlarged dataset containing 3.5M new crystals, obtained by combining the MPtraj and sAlex datasets. This model, released as [MACE-MPA-0](https://github.com/ACEsuit/mace-mp/releases/tag/mace_mpa_0), achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the Matbench benchmarks and significantly improves accuracy compared to the MACE-MP-0 models on material systems.

We do not guarantee that the second generation models are better than the first generation models in all cases, but they are expected to be more stable during MD simulations.
